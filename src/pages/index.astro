	<h2>Background</h2>
	<p>
		In the aftermath of the great blocksize war, the Lightning Network sprung up as a feasible scaling solution for the Bitcoin Network.
		Over the years we have seen tremendous progress and adoption with lots of projects, innovations, ideas that make the network more robust.
	</p>
	<p>
		There has been great progress in making Lightning easier to use, with concepts such as Lightning Service Provider helping and guiding the user
		regarding things such as channel management.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have also seen protocols making Lightning Network wallets be more interoperable with the web, with the web protocol suite LNURL along with
		the Lightning Address format.
	</p>
	<h2>Enter Blixt Wallet</h2>
	<p>
		Blixt Wallet is an open-source non-custodial Bitcoin Lightning Wallet for Android, iOS and macOS.
		It's a full Lightning node running a real lnd node inside the mobile app, giving tremendous power, utility and flexibility for the user.
		Rather than abstracting away concepts such as channels, Blixt Wallet tries to present them in a pedagogical way.
	</p>
	<p>
		Users enjoy a convenient default operation. Funds being sent to the wallet (on-chain or Lightning) will make use of the
		Blixt Lightning Service Provider called Dunder. This means it's easy for new users to get on-boarded to the Lightning Network.
	</p>
	<p>
		The Blixt Wallet project has an official Lightning node (LSP) that wallet users can open channels to.
		The node is well connected within the network and usually ranks high in node scoring lists.
		This makes sure that users will have a good experience when using the wallet.
	</p>
	<p>
		For users who want more control, Blixt Wallet is designed to be customizable and they can enjoy a rich set of options.
		They can choose to sync with their own Bitcoin node.
		They can choose to stay more private by enabling the built-in Tor functionality.
		If they have their own Lightning routing node, they can open a channel towards it instead of our Lightning node.
	</p>
	<p>
		We keep up with cutting edge development and the app has very rich support for emerging technologies such as LNURL, Lightning Address, WebLN, Keysend and more.
	</p>
	<p>
		Blixt Wallet stays close to lnd and the wallet is running it internally without any modifications. This means that Blixt Wallet funds
		can easily be recovered via lnd on desktop.
		<br />
		Because of this design choice, Blixt Wallet is usually the go-to solution for users with an Umbrel node that has stopped working. They can
		safely recover their funds by restoring with Blixt Wallet.
	</p>
	<h2>Strong Community</h2>
	<div style="float: left; margin-right: 16px">
		<img src="/growth.jpg" width="220" />
		<div><small>Active Android users</small></div>
	</div>
	<p>
		Despite being one of the smaller wallets, Blixt Wallet has a strong and helpful community. Users in need of help have a lot of guides and resources
		at their disposal.
		<br />
		The official Telegram chat group is very active with over 500 users. This is comparable to other more popular Lightning wallets.
		We have a healthy set of enthusiastic users and contributors.
	</p>
	<p>
		Ever since mid 2021, Blixt Wallet is seeing a steady growth in number of users.
		The app is spreading via grassroots support and we see independent people reviewing Blixt Wallet on YouTube, Twitter and other platforms.
		<br />
		Blixt Wallet is especially growing in Spanish-speaking countries, with an estimate of 50% users being Spanish-speaking.
		Since version 0.6.0 the app is translated into Spanish (along with 8 other languages).
	</p>
	<div style="clear: both"></div>

	<h2>A Bitcoin ethos midset</h2>
	<p>
		Blixt Wallet is being developed with a Bitcoin ethos. The application is fully open-source with an MIT license.
		<br />
		All related services and projects such as Dunder LSP are also open-source and users can choose to run their own LSP
		if they want to.
		<br />
	</p>
	<h2>Planning for the future</h2>
	<p>
		The Blixt Wallet project has many plans moving forward and we will list the larger topics here.
	</p>
	<h3>Dunder LSP</h3>
	<p>
		Dunder LSP is our Lightning Service Provider software.
		<br />
		It's built in NodeJS and works together with a normal lnd node. This makes it easy for anyone to run their own LSP
		if they wanted to.
		<br />
		Dunder LSP works together with Blixt Wallet, but other Lightning wallets can also choose to support it.
	</p>
	<p>
		It currently supports on-demand channels, meaning Dunder LSP can open a channel on-the-fly if the user does not have
		sufficient inbound liquidity.
		The user simply has to create an invoice inside Blixt Wallet and Dunder LSP will automatically kick in.
		<br />
		This functionality is currently under open beta. We wish to make the service robust and production-ready.
	</p>
	<p>
		We wish to further extend the LSP software with other functionality such as LN<->on-chain swaps and other features.
	</p>
	<h3>Desktop versions</h3>
	<div style="float: right; margin-left: 16px">
		<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3824379/196162476-d3d0bd94-4e12-41cc-9336-cc1f31dd0306.png" width="200" />
		<div><small>Blixt Wallet for macOS</small></div>
	</div>
	<p>
		Since version 0.6.0, Blixt Wallet is also avaiable on the macOS, joining as one of the few Lightning wallets for the desktop.
		We wish to further establish Blixt Wallet on the desktop with Windows and Linux versions too.
	</p>
	<p>
		As Blixt Wallet is developed in react-native, this means that most of the codebase can be re-used for other platforms.
		Work is already on-going on a Linux version, but we plan to start working on a Windows version as well.
	</p>
	<div style="clear: both"></div>
	<h3>Lightning Box</h3>
	<p>
		Lightning Box is a trust-minimized Lightning Address solution for non-custodial wallets.
		<br />
		The Lightning Box provider will take payments on behalf of the user and then notify them via a communication medium.
		The user can then open up their wallet in order to drain the cached funds via LNURL-withdraw.
	</p>
	<p>
		If the user wallet is already online at the time of the payment, the funds can be forwarded to the wallet, without requiring any trust.
	</p>
	<p>
		Lightning Address is a tricky problem to solve for non-custodial wallets.
		Right now if you want to use Lightning Address, there is no non-custodial mobile wallet that you can use.
		The options are either to host your own infrastructure or use a custodial wallet.
	</p>
	<p>
		While our Lightning Box solution is custodial, it's supposed to minimize risks and providers may choose to limit the max amount that
		the Box will hold for each user. The user is supposed to withdraw from the box as soon as possible.
	</p>
	<p>
		With the same design as Dunder LSP, the Lightning Box software will also be easy to self-deploy, only requiring an lnd node and NodeJS.
	</p>
	<h3>Push notification chain syncing via Firebase</h3>
	<p>
		In order to keep up with the chain, Blixt Wallet on Android sync via a background job every 3 hours.
		<br />
		However, depending on phone vendor and other factors, it's not a guarantee that the sync job will start up.
		Furthermore this feature is not available for iOS.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to improve upon this, we plan to implement Firebase high-priority push notifications.
		This has a stronger guarantee of waking the app up on Android and will allow scheduled background sync for
		the first time on our iOS app.
	</p>
	<h3>Bitcoin.Design collaboration</h3>
	<p>
		We have a collaboration with the Bitcoin Design collective, with focus on revamping the on-boarding experience.
	</p>
	<h3>Sync optimizations</h3>
	<p>
		In order to improve user experience, we are working on optimizing chain and lightning graph synchronization.
	</p>

	<h2>Financials</h2>
	<p>
		Since the project's inception in the beginning of 2019. It has been self-funded by the founder Hampus Sjöberg.
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to keep this project going and stay independent, we are seeking a grant to cover the following:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Full-time salary for Hampus Sjöberg of $50k/year</li>
		<li>Minor server costs of $1200/year</li>
		<li>Liqudity to keep our Dunder LSP instance running</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Thank you for considering our project proposal.
